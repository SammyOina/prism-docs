# Prism

Prism is a web based SAAS that is intended for use by the end user, to allow for a user in an project to benefit from the entire CoCoS AI system. Prism adds a layer of security and user management to the CoCoS AI system by providing functionality such as:

- User and Consortium (project) creation and management
- Policy creation and management (between users, projects, and computations)
- Billing and payment management
- Computation creation and management

## What is CocosAI

CoCoS.ai is a distributed, microservice-based solution in the cloud that enables confidential and privacy-preserving AI/ML, i.e. execution of model training and algorithm inference on confidential data sets. Privacy-preservation is considered a “holy grail” of AI. It opens many possibilities, among which is a collaborative, trustworthy AI. The final product enables data scientists to train AI and ML models on confidential data that is never revealed, and can be used for Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). AI/ML on combined data sets that come from different sources will unlock huge value.
